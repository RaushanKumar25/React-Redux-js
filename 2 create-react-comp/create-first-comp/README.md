# React Component Practice â€“ create-first-comp

:This project is a simple React setup built with **Vite** to practice creating and understanding components.

### 1. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Hp\first-react-app\2 create-react-comp\create-first-comp"

# Hereâ€™s the updated App.jsx code (you can replace the default content with this):

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is my first React Component!</h1>
      <p>React makes building user interfaces easier and more fun.</p>
      <Greeting />
    </div>
  );
}

function Greeting() {
  return (
    <h2>Welcome to React ðŸš€</h2>
  );
}

export default App;
