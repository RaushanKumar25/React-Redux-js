# Fragments:

Fragments let you return multiple elements from a component without wrapping them in an extra wrapper div.

In React, a component must return a single parent element. Sometimes you don’t want to add an unnecessary container like a <div> just to satisfy that rule. Extra <div>s can mess up your layout, styling, or cause unwanted nesting.
