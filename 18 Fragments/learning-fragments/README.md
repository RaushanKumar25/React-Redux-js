# Fragments:

Fragments let you return multiple elements from a component without wrapping them in an extra wrapper div.

In React, a component must return a single parent element. Sometimes you don’t want to add an unnecessary container like a <div> just to satisfy that rule. Extra <div>s can mess up your layout, styling, or cause unwanted nesting.



#React Map Function

The map() function in React is used to loop through arrays and render elements dynamically inside components.
It’s one of the most common methods for displaying lists of data like users, products, or tasks.

🔍 What It Does

The map() function:

Iterates over an array.

Returns a new array with elements transformed or displayed in JSX.

Helps render multiple components or HTML elements efficiently.

🧠 Why Use It in React

React components often display lists of data. Instead of writing repetitive JSX, map() helps generate them programmatically, keeping your code clean and scalable.

Conditional Rendering in React

Conditional rendering in React means showing or hiding parts of the UI based on certain conditions.
It works the same way conditions work in JavaScript, but the output is JSX.

🔍 Why It's Used

Show different components based on user actions
Hide elements until data loads
Display messages, errors, or alternative views
Build dynamic and interactive interfaces
